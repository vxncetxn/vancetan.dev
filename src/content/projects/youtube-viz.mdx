This visualisation was done as part of NCTU's 5226: Data Visualization and Visual
Analytics. This visualisation <Highlight>aimed to show the trends on Youtube from both a
regional and a time-series perspective</Highlight>. I developed the frontend of the visualisation
by starting off with React as a reactive wrapper. I then used D3 to create an <Highlight>interactive
and layered visualisation with multiple views</Highlight> - the primary view being a circle pack layout
and the secondary view being a time-series graph.
