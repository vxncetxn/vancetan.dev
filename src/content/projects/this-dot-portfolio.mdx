I created this portfolio site as a <Highlight>tiny little hub for myself on the vast interwebs</Highlight>
that can house my projects and writings, and for people to learn more about me and
my experiences. I designed the central graphic on the main page of the portfolio
to <Highlight>convey the idea of the fresh, innovative and creative output that comes from me</Highlight>
(and my brain). I then developed the portfolio with Gatsby, and implemented some other
elements such as a page transition that ties in well with the central graphic, easter
eggs, etc.
