This visualisation was done as part of SUTD's 02.137DH: Introduction to Digital
Humanities. This visualisation <Highlight>sought to illustrate the broader themes of
isolation and communities</Highlight> via looking at the characters' speech counts and networks.
Before creating the visualisation, I used Python within a Jupyter Notebooks
environment to <Highlight>distil preliminary insights and produce our eventual dataset</Highlight>.
I then employed D3 to create an <Highlight>interactive force-directed network visualisation</Highlight>.
