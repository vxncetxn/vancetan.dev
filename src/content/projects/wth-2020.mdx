What The Hack 2020 is the 3rd iteration of SUTD's annual student-run hackathon.
Starting from some graphic concept pieces provided by the design team, I designed
and developed a website that is thematically coherent and aligned with the theme
of Environment, which includes elements such as the user interface, graphic assets,
and a light/dark theme that goes beyond mere color palette changes. I also developed
a custom registration form with form validation managed by serverless functions.
