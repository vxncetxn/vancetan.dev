What The Hack 2020 is the 3rd iteration of SUTD's annual student-run hackathon.
Starting from some graphic concept pieces provided by the design team, I
designed and developed with Vue a website that is <Highlight>thematically coherent and
aligned with the theme of Environment</Highlight>, which includes elements such as the user
interface, graphic assets, and a light/dark theme that <Highlight>goes beyond mere color
palette changes</Highlight>. I also developed a custom registration form with form validation
managed by serverless functions.
