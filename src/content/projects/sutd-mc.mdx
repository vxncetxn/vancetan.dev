This landing page for the SUTD Minecraft Project was created to showcase the efforts
of the Minecraft rendition of SUTD which was the centrepiece for the school's
virtual Open House 2020. I designed and developed a website that 
is <Highlight>evocative of the Minecraft aesthetic and experience</Highlight> featuring elements such as 
a retro game-like font, an animated pickaxe cursor and a <Highlight>showpiece built
with the native Canvas API that has a unique pixelated page transition effect</Highlight>.
