<i>The Next Stage</i> is a fundraising initiative for Esplanade's upcoming Singtel Waterfront 
Theatre slated for completion in 2022. I <Highlight>worked with my team to conceptualise an innovative
and interactive donation experience</Highlight> - donors will be able to create unique virtual mementos
which memorialises their contributions to the cause - and subsequently actualised it by developing
it into a full-fledged product. I designed and developed a landing page in React and Next.js 
which also <Highlight>featured the mementos which are 3D elements built with Three.js and react-three-fiber</Highlight>.
I also developed the backend infrastructure with Node.js and PostgreSQL to <Highlight>support several functions
of the project such as persistence of donor and donation data and authentication via magic links</Highlight>.
